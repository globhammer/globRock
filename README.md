#### Node WebKit Video Game Engine ####

The aim of this project is to provide a method of creating Fine Art games to be shown in galleries and museums for hundreds of years.
globROCK also allows everyone to distrubute thier editions as easily as possible.

If you’re interested in the globROCK then feel free to follow the art collective on twitter
([@globHAMMER](https://twitter.com/globHAMMER)) and we will keep you posted on our progress!  

And of course check back on [our site](<http://www.globHAMMER.com/glob/>) as our process will be discussed there too!
